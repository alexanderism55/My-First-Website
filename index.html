            <big>Many of us have dreamt</big> of one day quitting our jobs and
            living our lives to the fullest doing
            <b>what ever the fuck we want</b>. However, life is not really that
            easy, after all you need money to survive and money does not fall of
            trees. To most of us quitting you job is just not a realistic thing
            to do. But I might have an idea or 2 on how you can make a
            substantial amount of money where; maybe you wont not work but you
            might be able to quite your job.

            let me tell you how I believe I can absolutely make money enough so
            that not only i wont have to work but ill probably get a passive
            income empire. My tactic is so fire that you will be sweating like
            its 50<sup>0</sup>. You better bring some of that H<sub>2</sub>0.
